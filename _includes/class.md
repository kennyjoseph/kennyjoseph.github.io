# Prerequisites

It is assumed that students have some background in machine learning. Also, although not required, this course will likely be most interesting to those with an interest in the social sciences and/or humanities.

# Course Credits

You can take this seminar for 1, 2, or 3 credits. For one credit, your responsibility is to read papers and write critiques on the course slack channel. For two credits, you will also need to present a paper to the class. For three credits, you will also organize an activity for the class, constructing a jupyter notebook that you lead us through using an interesting method relevant to the course.

# Grading

The class will be (and is required to be) graded pass/fail.  There are three course components: [readings](#readings), [presentations](#paper-presentations), and [activities](#activity).

- For 1 credit, you must pass the readings component only
- For 2 credits, you must pass the readings and presentation components
- For 3 credits, you must pass the readings, presentation, and activity components.

All students must adhere to the [attendance policy](#attendance-policy) as well.


## Attendance Policy 

**Missing more than three scheduled course meetings will result in a failing grade**. The only condition under which the student can still pass the course if they miss more than three scheduled meetings is if **all but one** absence is documented with the instructor and due to the following reasons (from [UB's official policy](https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/attendance.html)):
- military obligations
- religious observances
- illness documented by a physician or other appropriate health care professional
- conflicts with university-sanctioned activities documented by an appropriate university administrator
- public emergencies
- documented personal or family emergencies

**Consistently being more than 5 minutes late to class will result in me counting you as absent**. Specifically, every three times that you are more than 5 minutes late will be counted as a missed class. **There are no exceptions to this policy**. 

Please note that I *do not need a reason for missing class if you miss three or less*. That is, as long as you don't miss more than three classes, you can be absent for any reason. Note, however, that you will not receive credit for attendance on those days **unless documentation is provided for one of the reasons above**.

## Readings

Each week, readings are graded on a pass/fail basis. You must complete all of the following to pass:
- A [one to two paragraph response on Slack](#reading-responses-on-slack) to one of the two readings
-  A useful [comment](#comments-on-responses-on-slack) on someone else's response
- Attendence at and [active participation](#class-participation) in class, which includes the ability to discuss *both* papers

**There are 13 weeks of reading assignments. You must have a passing grade for at least 10 weeks. Note then that if you don't plan on attending, you shouldn't feel obligated to do the readings for a given week, and vice versa.** 

In addition, if you take the course for more than one credit, you will present a paper to the class. These presentations will be graded on a pass/fail basis which requires that you sufficiently complete the following tsks:
- 12 minute presentation of the paper (guidelines below)
- Lead the discussion of the paper in class)

For students taking the course for three credits, a final pass/fail component of the course is the partner-planned activity, see [activity](#activity).

### Reading Responses on Slack

All responses to readings must be put onto Slack by **Sunday at 11:59PM**, onto the slack channel for that week's readings.  Responses submitted after this time or to a different channel will not be accepted.

Responses to readings should have two paragraphs  **Before these two paragraphs, state the paper you are responding to in bold.  See the #intro channel for example responses**.
The first paragraph might choose to address some of the following questions, but should not feel inclined to simply answer only or all these questions:

- What is the main point of the paper?
- What novel technical insights does the paper have, if any?
- What novel social science insights does the paper have, if any?
- What is the biggest strength of the paper, if any?
- What is the biggest weakness of the paper, if any?

The second paragraph might consider some of the following questions:

- Does this paper help you think in a new way about a problem you're working on?
- Is there a part of the paper you found particularly confusing that you'd like help understanding?
- How does this paper link to some of the other papers we discussed this week?

This second paragraph will serve as the basis for discussion during the class.

### Comments on Responses on Slack

All comments must be put onto Slack by **Monday at 11:59PM**, replying to another response or comment from someone else on the slack channel for that week's readings.  Comments submitted after this time or to a different channel will not be accepted.

**Further, all comments should be civil.  Verbal abuse or intimidation, or attempts to make others "feel dumb" or that are offensive in any way will not be tolerated.  If you believe your comment might fall into this space, please me an email before posting it so we can discuss this.  Any violation of this practice will be treated as a violation of the university's policy for Academic Integrity**
### Class participation

Students are expected to actively participate in discussion of all papers for which they give a response.  Students should expect to be called upon to discuss the responses they give on Slack during class and to address other potential discussion topics.



## Paper presentations

Paper presentations are expected to be 12 minutes long (give or take a minute or two).  Slides are not due beforehand, but I am happy to provide feedback if the slides are sent before Tuesday.  I will also ask that slides are sent to me after the presentation in PDF format in order to post them to the website. 

The presentation should cover the following, although you may choose to spend more or less time on particular parts (i.e. you may want to spend a lot of time on the methodology if its a methods paper, or the interesting results if it is an application paper):

- A summary slide - what was the main point of the paper, the main methods and data used, and the main conclusion
- Detailed summary of the paper
	- What were the main research questions or hypotheses that the paper was looking at? Or, what was the main technical challenge the paper was seeking to address?
	- Why is (or isn't) this an important problem? I.e. why is (or isn't) this paper interesting and important?
	- How did this paper go about answering these research questions?
		- Details on the data, including potential biases within it
		- Details on the methodology - you should give enough detail here that someone who has not read the paper at all can grasp all steps of the methodology
	- What are the main results of the paper, in terms of the research questions posed?
	
- Your personal take on the paper
	- Would you recommend this paper to others? Why or why not?
	- What are the key weaknesses of this paper?
	- What are the key strengths of this paper?
	- If this is a methods paper, where else do you think this method could be useful; i.e. what other datasets or kinds of data? Would the method need to be changed in order to do so?
	- If this is an application paper, what other methods do you think might have been applicable to the problem? Would using a different method have been better or lead to different conclusions? If so, how/why?
	- Can you think of other related papers beyond the ones the authors reference, e.g. papers that followed after this one? nAre there any related papers you think people should read if they are interested in this topic?
	
- A summary of the slack discussion around this paper.  What were the most popular responses? Were there any things people didn't understand? Have you clarified them?
- What would be useful for the class to discuss for this paper? Give at least three points for further discussion.

Additionally, the first slide should contain:
- Title of the paper
- Paper authors
- Full citation of the paper (APA format or similar is fine)
- Your name and the date of the presentation.

## Activity

Students taking the course for three credits will, in teams of two, organize an activity for the rest of the class at some point during the semester.  The activity should take roughly 10 minutes to explain, and engage your classmates for roughly 20-30 minutes as they work through your activity.

**Your idea for an activity must be approved by Kenny before you conduct it.** The activity will likely take the form of your team developing a notebook (either in CoLab or distributed to the class) that leverages a technique relevant to the seminar and shows how it can be applied in some interesting fashion. Potential tools that might be demoed during an activity include:

- https://github.com/sf-wa-326/phrase-bert-topic-model
- https://github.com/MilaNLProc/contextualized-topic-models
- https://github.com/ryanjgallagher/focalevents
- https://github.com/ryanjgallagher/corex_topic
- https://github.com/bahareharandizade/keyetm
- https://github.com/HazyResearch/snorkel
- http://flaviovdf.github.io/tribeflow
- https://github.com/LIAAD/yake

However, I am wide open to ideas, so we can discuss!
