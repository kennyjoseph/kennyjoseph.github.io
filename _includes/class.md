# Overview 

This seminar course will focus on giving students a broad understanding of state-of-the-art methods in NLP and how they can be applied to address questions in the social sciences and/or humanities. Topics will also include other relevant areas of computational social science, including social network analysis and large-scale experimental design.

# Prerequisites

It is assumed that students have some background in machine learning. Also, although not required, this course will likely be most interesting  to those with an interest in the social sciences and/or humanities.

# Course Credits

You can take this seminar for either 1 credit or 3 credits. With 1 credit, your responsibility is to read papers, write and respond to critiques on the course slack channel, and present at least one paper to the class. With 3 credits, you will also design and carry out a research project that will be presented in a poster session at the end of the semester

# Grading

Grading is S/U. 

Each week is graded on a five point scale:
- A one-paragraph response on Slack to at least three of the five readings (see below for details; **1 point per reading**)
- Two useful comments on someone else's response (**.5 points per comment, up to 1 point, or two comments**)
- Active participation in class (**3 points**)

In addition, you will present two papers to the class. These presentations will be graded on an additional 15-points:
- 15 minute presentation of the paper (guidelines below; **11 points**)
- Taking part in leading the discussion of the paper in class (**4 points**)

There are a total of 12 weeks, plus two paper presentations, for a total of **114 points**.   Students taking the course for 1 credit must do the following to pass the course:
- Get at least **90 points**
- Actively participate in class discussions
- Miss no more than two weeks of class unless explicit permission is granted by the instructor
- Present two papers

For students taking the course for three credits, an additional **57 points** are allocated to the project - 28 for a final (short) writeup of the project, and 27 for the poster presentation.  Details on the course project are provided below.




# Class stuff - participation, reading responses, comments and presentations

We will use the "three pass" reading system described [here](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~stevko/courses/cse704/fall10/papers/p83-keshav.pdf). For your three responses to papers, you should use a "second pass" style of reading. For any other papers assigned (i.e. if there are more than three readings for a given week), use a "first pass" style for papers you did not write responses to.  For your presentations, you should be taking a "third pass" approach to reading the articles.  Keep in mind these are loose guidelines, not strict characterizations of how you should read the paper

## Class participation

Students are expected to actively participate in discussion of all papers for which they give a response.  Students should expect to be called upon to discuss the responses they give on Slack during class. 

## Reading Responses on Slack

All responses to readings must be put onto Slack by **Wednesday at 11:59PM**, onto the slack channel for that week's readings.  Responses submitted after this time or to a different channel will not be accepted.

Responses to readings must be at least two paragraphs long (roughly 5-7 sentences each).  

The first paragraph should summarize the paper. You may choose to address some of the following questions, but should not feel inclined to simply answer only these questions:

- What is the main point of the paper?
- What novel technical insights does the paper have, if any?
- What novel social science insights does the paper have, if any?
- What is the biggest strength of the paper, if any?
- What is the biggest weakness of the paper, if any?

The second paragraph should contain something particularly interesting or worrying or useful that you yourself got from the paper. It might be something small - a new way of thinking about a problem you're working on, for example.  It could also be a discussion of a part of the paper you found confusing, i.e. a request for others to help you understand part of the paper.  This second paragraph will serve as the basis for discussion during the class.

## Comments on Responses on Slack

All comments must be put onto Slack by **Wednesday at 11:59PM**, replying to another response or comment from someone else on the slack channel for that week's readings.  Comments submitted after this time or to a different channel will not be accepted.

**Further, all comments should be civil.  Verbal abuse or intimidation, or attempts to make others "feel dumb" or that are offensive in any way will not be tolerated.  If you believe your comment might fall into this space, please me an email before posting it so we can discuss this.  Any violation of this practice will be treated as a violation of the university's policy for Academic Integrity**

## Paper presentations

Paper presentations are expected to be 12 minutes long (give or take a minute or two).  Slides are not due beforehand, but I am happy to provide feedback if the slides are sent before Wednesday.  I will also ask that slides are sent to me after the presentation in PDF format in order to post them to the website. 

The presentation should cover the following, although you may choose to spend more or less time on particular parts (i.e. you may want to spend a lot of time on the methodology if its a methods paper, or the interesting results if it is an application paper):

- A summary slide - what was the main point of the paper, the main methods and data used, and the main conclusion
- Details on the data, including potential biases within it
- Details on the methodology - you should give enough detail here that someone who has not read the paper at all can grasp all steps of the methodology
- Details on related work - what else did the authors report as being similar to their work? Do you think they missed anything? Are there any related papers you think people should read if they are interested in this topic?
- What are the main results of the paper? Did you find them convincing? Why or why not?
- What are the key weaknesses of this paper?
- What are the key strengths of this paper?
- If this is a methods paper, where else do you think this method could be useful; i.e. what other datasets or kinds of data? Would the method need to be changed in order to do so?
- If this is an application paper, what other methods do you think might have been applicable to the problem? Would using a different method have been better or lead to different conclusions? If so, how/why?
- Would you recommend this paper to others? Why or why not?
- A summary of the slack discussion around this paper.  What were the most popular responses? Were there any things people didn't understand? Have you clarified them?
- What would be useful for the class to discuss for this paper? Give at least three points for further discussion.

Additionally, the first slide should contain:
- Title of the paper
- Paper authors
- Full citation of the paper (APA format or similar is fine)
- Your name and the date of the presentation.
