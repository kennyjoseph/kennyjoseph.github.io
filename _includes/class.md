# Prerequisites

It is assumed that students have some background in machine learning. Also, although not required, this course will likely be most interesting  to those with an interest in the social sciences and/or humanities.

# Course Credits

You can take this seminar for either 1 credit or 3 credits. With 1 credit, your responsibility is to read papers, write and respond to critiques on the course slack channel, and present two papers to the class. With 3 credits, you will also design and carry out a research project that will be presented in a poster session at the end of the semester

# Grading

The class will be graded out of 150 points.

Each weeks [readings](#readings) is graded on a seven point scale:
- A [one to two paragraph response on Slack](#reading-responses-on-slack) to at least three readings (**1 point per reading**)
- Two useful [comments](#comments-on-responses-on-slack) on someone else's response (**.5 points per comment, up to 1 point, or two comments**)
- Attendence at and [active participation](#class-participation) in class, which includes the ability to discuss up to 3 papers for that week (**3 points**)

Important notes on weekly graded assignments:
- **There are 12 weeks of reading assignments. I will grade out of a possible of 10 weeks for each sub-assignment. So responses are graded out of 30 points, comments out of 10, and attendence/participation out of 30.**
- **Every class you miss after the first 2 will be a letter deduction from your grade (i.e. A to A-).**

In addition, you will present two papers to the class. These presentations will be graded on an additional 15-points:
- 12 minute presentation of the paper (guidelines below; **10 points**)
- Taking part in leading the discussion of the paper in class (**5 points**)

Students taking the course for 1 credit or as S/U must do the following to pass the course:
- Get at least **100 points**
- Actively participate in class discussions
- Miss no more than two weeks of class unless explicit permission is granted by the instructor
- Present two papers

For students taking the course for three credits, an additional **80 points** are allocated to the [project](#project).

Final letter grades will be given according to how many points students obtain. Breakdowns (percentagewise):

- A	[92.5,100]
- A-	[87.5,92.5)
- B+	[82.5,87.5)
- B	[77.5,82.5)
- B-	[72.5,77.5)
- C+	[67.5,72.5)
- C	[62.5,67.5)
- C-	[57.5,62.5)

# Reading and paper presentation details

## Readings 

We will use the "three pass" reading system described [here](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~stevko/courses/cse704/fall10/papers/p83-keshav.pdf). For your three responses to papers, you should use a "second pass" style of reading. For any other papers assigned (i.e. if there are more than three readings for a given week), use a "first pass" style for papers you did not write responses to.  For your presentations, you should be taking a "third pass" approach to reading the articles.  Keep in mind these are loose guidelines, not strict characterizations of how you should read the paper

## Class participation

Students are expected to actively participate in discussion of all papers for which they give a response.  Students should expect to be called upon to discuss the responses they give on Slack during class and to address other potential discussion topics.

## Reading Responses on Slack

All responses to readings must be put onto Slack by **Wednesday at 11:59PM**, onto the slack channel for that week's readings.  Responses submitted after this time or to a different channel will not be accepted.

Responses to readings must be at least two paragraphs long (roughly 5-7 sentences each).  

The first paragraph should summarize the paper. You may choose to address some of the following questions, but should not feel inclined to simply answer only these questions:

- What is the main point of the paper?
- What novel technical insights does the paper have, if any?
- What novel social science insights does the paper have, if any?
- What is the biggest strength of the paper, if any?
- What is the biggest weakness of the paper, if any?

The second paragraph should contain something particularly interesting or worrying or useful that you yourself got from the paper. It might be something small - a new way of thinking about a problem you're working on, for example.  It could also be a discussion of a part of the paper you found confusing, i.e. a request for others to help you understand part of the paper.  This second paragraph will serve as the basis for discussion during the class.

## Comments on Responses on Slack

All comments must be put onto Slack by **Wednesday at 11:59PM**, replying to another response or comment from someone else on the slack channel for that week's readings.  Comments submitted after this time or to a different channel will not be accepted.

**Further, all comments should be civil.  Verbal abuse or intimidation, or attempts to make others "feel dumb" or that are offensive in any way will not be tolerated.  If you believe your comment might fall into this space, please me an email before posting it so we can discuss this.  Any violation of this practice will be treated as a violation of the university's policy for Academic Integrity**

## Paper presentations

Paper presentations are expected to be 12 minutes long (give or take a minute or two).  Slides are not due beforehand, but I am happy to provide feedback if the slides are sent before Wednesday.  I will also ask that slides are sent to me after the presentation in PDF format in order to post them to the website. 

The presentation should cover the following, although you may choose to spend more or less time on particular parts (i.e. you may want to spend a lot of time on the methodology if its a methods paper, or the interesting results if it is an application paper):

- A summary slide - what was the main point of the paper, the main methods and data used, and the main conclusion
- Details on the data, including potential biases within it
- Details on the methodology - you should give enough detail here that someone who has not read the paper at all can grasp all steps of the methodology
- Details on related work - what else did the authors report as being similar to their work? Do you think they missed anything? Are there any related papers you think people should read if they are interested in this topic?
- What are the main results of the paper? Did you find them convincing? Why or why not?
- What are the key weaknesses of this paper?
- What are the key strengths of this paper?
- If this is a methods paper, where else do you think this method could be useful; i.e. what other datasets or kinds of data? Would the method need to be changed in order to do so?
- If this is an application paper, what other methods do you think might have been applicable to the problem? Would using a different method have been better or lead to different conclusions? If so, how/why?
- Would you recommend this paper to others? Why or why not?
- A summary of the slack discussion around this paper.  What were the most popular responses? Were there any things people didn't understand? Have you clarified them?
- What would be useful for the class to discuss for this paper? Give at least three points for further discussion.

Additionally, the first slide should contain:
- Title of the paper
- Paper authors
- Full citation of the paper (APA format or similar is fine)
- Your name and the date of the presentation.

# Project Details

***Disclaimer: I stole this project idea, and consequently a decent portion of the text below, directly from [Prof. Jacob Eisenstein](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-css-class/blob/master/grading.md).*** 

The final project in the class involves replicating and extending a published paper in computational social science. This project is to be performed in teams of *2* students, and the paper must be approved by the professor before the submission of the formal proposal. A list of recommended papers can be found [from Jacob's original list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O9pofBgcqhAE7Oz9cw5XoSMu18jrR49e9O-I0xfu7OU/edit#gid=1224542966) or one from [the list that I have created](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Ker4ItaEcN6jZecg98y_qkgKpRtKUh45Jtt9AVWuhE/edit?usp=sharing). You can also suggest your own, although it should be comparable to those on this list.  If there is an odd number of students, I will allow one group of three students.

There will be a series of deadlines for the projects throughout the semester. All submissions for the dates below should be emailed to me (except for the in person meeting and the presentation, obviously). Again, make sure to prefix the subject of the email with [CSE702].  All submissions are due before 11:59PM on the date listed:

- **February 14th** - Email me with the names of the members of your team, and your team name (5 points)
- **February 28th** - Meet with the professor to finalize project idea with the professor (I will send out a doodle to get everyone scheduled). Come to the meeting prepared with at least 2 potential project ideas. (5)
- **March 17th** - [Project proposal](#project-proposal) (15)
- **April 18th** - Check-in with professor about ongoing progress of replication and extension effort. (5)
- **May 9th** - [Poster presentations](#poster-presentations) (25)
- **May 14th** - [Final project reports due](#final-reports) (25)

## Project Proposal

One team member should submit the proposal for the entire team.  If you submit in LaTex, please send along the source so I can provide comments in a shared overleaf document. The proposal should indicate:

- The names of team members 
- What paper you plan to replicate (full citation) and why
- A summary of the key elements/main findings of the paper:
	- from a social science perspective (i.e. what theoretical approach was taken? Were there hypotheses presented? What new social science knowledge was produced, if any?)
	- from a computational perspective (i.e. some details about the methods and data - was it novel?)
- Details on how you plan to validate the paper:
	- Data: what you need, and where you can get it?
	- Methods: what computational techniques do you plan to employ, and how will you do it? Will you write your own code? Is there a software library you can use?
	- Metrics: how will you know if you have succeeded in replicating the paper? Be as specific as possible. If the paper has multiple findings, indicate how you will test that you have replicated each one.
	- Risks: What might go wrong that would cause this project to fail? What can you do to ameliorate these risks, and what will you do in this worst-case scenario?
	- Limits: are there findings that you will not be able to replicate? If so, explain why the parts that you can replicate are interesting enough on their own.
- Who is doing what - a task breakdown by individual on the team
- Stretch goals: If the main findings of the paper are relatively easy to replicate given the data and resources that are available to you (something we will discuss together), how do you plan to go further, making an original contribution of your own? 

## Final Report

Your final report should be submitted as a PDF and be no longer than ten pages in AAAI format. For this, you can use either the [AAAI overleaf template](https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php) or take the Word or Latex file from [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/aaai-press-latex-template/jymjdgdpdmxp).

The format of your report can be loosely aligned with that of the typical research papers we have read, i.e. it will likely have the at least the following sections:

- Introduction - This section should explain the objective of your project - what were you trying to do (or, if you're doing a pure replication, what was the original paper trying to do)?  It should also explain why that objective is important - why do you want to carry out this research, how would it move our understanding of the social world forward?

- Background Section - This section will provide a literature review that would be appropriate for a conference paper, and should include works covered in class that are relevant to your research question. If you're doing a pure replication, don't just copy/paste their reference section; think critically about what other work you've learned about might be related here!

- Data description - How did you collect this data? What are the strengths and weaknesses of it? How does the data that you have to analyze compare to the data in the paper you're replicating?

- Methodology - What was the approach you took to analyze the data. How did this approach compare to the original paper? Was it the same? If so, how can you be sure? If not, what's different, and why? Explain the methods here as if you were providing details of your approach to someone who does not know the intimate details of the original paper.

- Results – Provide the results of your analysis, and compare them to the results of the original paper.  If the replication did not succeed, try to explain why not. Were you lacking key information from the original authors? Were you unable to obtain the same data? If the replication did succeed, try to explain the limitations of your replication: would it work on other data? Does it rely on the method being implemented in exactly the same way as the original authors did?

- Conclusion - What did you learn - about computational social science, replication, and the original paper? What other important things did you glean from your analyses that may not have been noted in the original paper (especially if you carried out an extension of it)?
