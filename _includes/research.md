# About Me
 
I am an assistant professor in the [CSE](https://www.cse.buffalo.edu/) Department at the University at Buffalo. At UB, I mostly work with folks in the [Computing for Social Good](https://c4sg.cse.buffalo.edu/) group. 

<span style="color:red"> I am, unfortunately, not currently looking for students to work with. I apologize, and hope this will change in the future. However, as such, I cannot promise that I will be able to quickly respond to requests for opportunities to work together. </span> 

<!-- If you're interested in working together, please send me an email at the address below.</span> Note that while I do not expect any particular skills, you should have a strong interest in both computational modeling of text/networks **and** in sociology, (social) psychology or the humanities.  I am especially seeking to work with students from underrepresented groups in computer science.-->

In the past, I was a postdoc at the [LazerLab](http://www.lazerlab.net/) at the [Network Science Institute](http://www.networkscienceinstitute.org) at Northeastern University and a fellow at Harvard's [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](http://www.iq.harvard.edu/). I completed my graduate work in the [Societal Computing program](http://www.cmu.edu/scs/sc-phd/) in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied under Kathleen Carley in the [CASOS](http://casos.cs.cmu.edu) lab. 

My research focuses on obtaining a better understanding of the dynamics and cognitive representations of stereotypes and prejudice, and their interrelationships with sociocultural structure and behavior. In my work, I leverage a variety of machine learning/NLP methods, agent-based modeling strategies and socio-cognitive theories.

# Recent-ish Stuff

I have given up trying to keep this section up to date. For my most recent publications, please check out [my Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=TNS6P14AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I also post most of the interesting things going on (that is, I fawn over the great work of my students) [on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/_kenny_joseph).
