# About me
 
I am an associate professor in the [CSE](https://www.cse.buffalo.edu/) Department at the University at Buffalo.
In the past, I was a postdoc at the [LazerLab](http://www.lazerlab.net/) at the [Network Science Institute](http://www.networkscienceinstitute.org) at Northeastern University and a fellow at Harvard's [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](http://www.iq.harvard.edu/). I completed my graduate work in the [Societal Computing program](http://www.cmu.edu/scs/sc-phd/) in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied under Kathleen Carley in the [CASOS](http://casos.cs.cmu.edu) lab.
