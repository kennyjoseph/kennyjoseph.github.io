I really hate self-promotion. Growing up I was always told, and I believed, that if your work was good it would speak for itself.  This view was often reinforced, at least as I saw it. I never had to ask for recognition in school - if I scored high on a test, the teacher didn't need me to tell her/him that. If I scored a goal playing sports, I didn't need to tell my teammates what had happened. They were aware of how the game worked. Consequently, I generally felt that people who spent time talking themselves up were just wasting time they could have spent doing something useful.  I therefore believed that talking about myself was unnecessary- I was pretty confident that when my work was good, other people would eventually just figure that out as well...

In academia (or maybe just in adult life in general, these two are fairly difficult to separate for me), things seem to be quite different. That's because in academia, you can't just publish your work and expect people will find it. While putting it into top-tier venues can help, the truth seems to be that people talk about your work the more you tell them about it.  Not only that, people tend to talk about your work, as Gelman likes to remind us, the more you tell them it is novel (even when it isn't), the more you tell them it is statistically significant (even though that often is irrelevant) and the more you tell them it will "change everything" (even when it won't). 

While the Gelman-esque view is a bit cynical, it does make total sense that I have to step up and get others excited about my work to be successful. The attitude of "my work speaks for itself" doesn't fly, because even if your work speaks for itself once people read it, it is relatively unlikely that people will read your work until you first speak for it. This is not to say that the work I have produced "speaks for itself". Rather, the point is simply that I have realized that those who hope and/or expect this to be the case are almost always going to be wrong whether or not the work is as good as advertised. There's just too much other stuff out there already for me to just hope that other people are going to find my work within the mess.

One of my goals at conferences has therefore increasingly been to promote myself and my work to others. This conflicts with my view that talk is cheap, with my strong distaste in telling other people how great my work is and with the fact that I enjoy hearing about other people about 1000% more than I enjoy telling other people about myself and my work. Other people and their work are much more interesting by default - I know myself and my work really well, and don't know them or their work at all (or know it really well and just want to hear them talk about it).  

Most importantly, though, is that I fear more than anything else sounding like someone who loves themself. 

At this point, it is still a battle for me to talk about myself in a way that conveys the real excitement I feel about my work. As a result of the above, I often end up downplaying this excitement in an attempt to shift the conversation back to where I feel more comfortable - talking about someone besides me.  While I therefore still despise self-promotion, I can at least now accept that it is necessary and that its something I should make an effort towards.
