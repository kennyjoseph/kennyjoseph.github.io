With all the usual disclaimers (I don't usually do this, this isn't about politics, blah blah blah)...

More than any time in recent memory, I've been reminded recently that it is all too easy to believe that we understand the life of someone else enough to comment on it. That is, we can lead ourselves to believe that after spending an hour/afternoon/week reading or hearing about the lives of an African American, or a Syrian, or a Trump supporter, that we can speak with confidence about the beliefs, values, and/or the character of an individual we determine to be a member of this social group.  

This is pure bullshit. 

Humans have no god-given ability to understand how it feels to be poor, to be genetically predisposed to be sad, to have slipped through the cracks of social institutions and have nowhere to turn for help just by reading about it.  And, even if you believe you're special and do have that ability, in all likelihood you're getting the information you're using to make this decision through a second-hand source which is no doubt sensationalizing and censoring the information given.  This is true whether or not you're being told this by "the media", by a website you trust, or even by a person in the social group you're claiming to have knowledge about. People, and numbers have many, many ways to lie to you, both intentionally and unintentionally, and there are many, many different people that make up each social group we try to generalize. Characterizing someone else based on snippets of second-hand information is similar to watching highlights of Bills quarterbacks and concluding that because of what you've seen from Jack Kemp and Jim Kelly, in all likelihood JP Losman was good too. You're wrong, and its stupid. 

The ability to accept that you do not understand someone else's life and therefore have no right to provide your insights into it is independent of your political views. If someone feels that something in their life has led them to kneel during the national anthem, or to support Donald Trump, or to hate the police, then assume they have a reason and not just that they "are dumb" or "evil" or whatever. 

People don't make decisions for no reasons. They might not understand those reasons (i.e. these reasons may be due to the social system in which they were brought up), and you might not agree with those reasons, but don't assume that because you don't have the same reasons that this other person doesn't understand their own life. If you feel the need to make that assumption and talk about it, instead, express how your OWN life has led YOU to disagree. This is valuable information about the world that can be used by others to understand your views, reasons (at least, what you think those reasons are) and is far more constructive than you taking the time to express how your (probably incorrect or hopelessly generalized) views on the lives of other people have led you to make a decision, for you or for them.
